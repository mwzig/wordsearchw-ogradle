First Day 12/20:  on the plane (3.5 hours?) (no wifi! no googling!) getting a simple find to work, thinking 
of a horizontal row.  Then getting the coordinates, then searching backwards.

Second Day 12/21:  after family visit (3 hours?) (no googling still except for 2-dim arrays,
I want my solution to be original to me!!!).
Got the vertical fwd and backward searches working.  Started thinking about how
to search diagonally.  Realized I need a redesign and I need to have a GridLetter object
that has a Letter and its coordinates.  Then I need a 2-dim array of those to 
represent the word search grid.  Then I need to make a GridLine object out of those 
objects to represent horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.  Lots of thought on a better
class design to handle this problem.

Third Day 12/22:  spent some time with pencil and paper drawing out class desgins.


Fourth Day 12/23: back on the plane with some focused coding time.

12/24 - Creating tests for Grid object.
